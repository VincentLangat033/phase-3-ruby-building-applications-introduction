# Introduction to Configuring Ruby Applications

We have a number of outside resources we leverage in working with our Ruby
applications. For example, RSpec is a Ruby-specific library, or _gem_. We
leverage this testing tool for behavior-driven testing. As we start to build out
more complex applications, it's standard to utilize libraries and other
conventions for setting up Ruby applications. This will not only save time, but
will also offer a common template, that becomes familiar to Ruby developers.

We'll cover topics including:

- What is bundler?
- What is a gem?
- How do gems work?
- What is require?
- Why do we use require_relative?

In the next couple of lessons, we'll explain these tools and concepts that have
been designed for efficiency.
