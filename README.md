# Introduction to Configuring Ruby Applications

We have a number of outside resources we leverage in working with in our Ruby
applications. For example, ActiveRecord is a Ruby-specific library, or _gem_. We
leverage this to map our objects to database tables, instead of having write all
the ORM code manually for each project. As we start to build out more complex
applications, it's standard to utilize libraries and other conventions for
setting up Ruby applications. This will not only save time, but will also offer
a more a template, that becomes familiar to Ruby developers.

We'll cover topics including:

- What is bundler?
- What is a gem?
- How do gems work?
- What is require?
- Why do we use require_relative?

In the next couple of lessons, we'll explain these tools and concepts that have
been designed for efficiency.
